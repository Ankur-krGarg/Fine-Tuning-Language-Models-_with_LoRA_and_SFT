Features:
- Fine-tuning of the OPT language model using LoRA for efficient training.
- Utilizes SFT to adapt the model to specific datasets.
- Integration with Weights & Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking.
- Easy-to-follow code structure with clear documentation.

Requirements:
To run the code, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Google Colab or a local environment with GPU support
- Required libraries:
  - transformers
  - trl
  - deeplake
  - wandb
  - peft

You can install the required libraries using pip.

Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up your environment and run the code.

Usage:
- Load your dataset into the notebook.
- Use the provided functions to format the data for training.
- Fine-tune the model using the LoRA configuration.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.

Results:
The fine-tuned model demonstrates improved performance on specific tasks compared to the base model. Metrics such as training loss and validation loss are logged for analysis.
